			<h3>What should a Junior Developer Resume contain?</h3><br>
		</header>
		<p>! Important: write your Resume in English if you can, if possible</p><br>
		<p>1. First Name, Last Name (real ones)</p>
		<p>2. Contact Info (add several ways to contact you)</p>
		<p>3. Summary (your goal, wishes, reveal what is important for you, what do you want and why.</p>
		Some kind of self-presentation. In case of lack of experience Junior Developer sells his/her potential, his/her
		passion and ability to learn fast. You shouldn't think that everybody is going to teach you when you come to the
		workplace . Rather being a Junior means always
		learning new things from everywhere etc.).<br>
		<p>4. Skills (e.g. programming languages, frameworks, methodologies, version control, tools etc.)</p>
		<p>5. Code examples (LATEST)<br>
		<p>6. Experience (for a Junior Dev it means all kinds of experience: coding tests, projects from courses,
		freelance projects - wherever they had the opportunity to demonstrate skills they have.
		Also it would be awesome if you add links to source code)</p>
		<p>7. Education (including courses, seminars, lectures, online learning)</p>
		<p>8. English (elaborate on what kind of practice you had, if any, how long it lasted and so on)</p>
